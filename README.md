All students are required to blog during their programs - please see the "Blog Requirements & Submission" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic for information about blog requirements and submission.

## Why Blog?

As a professional data scientist, you'll often have to communicate in writing. Sometimes you'll have to write something technical for your peers, at other times you'll have to provide a non-technical summary for business stakeholders. In either case, it's important to be able to distill a complex technical topic and share in writing the most important points.

A blog can also help you to *get* a data science job. It's a way to showcase your skills to potential employers before they decide to interview you, so it's important to realize that your blog posts may well be reviewed by potential employers when deciding whether or not to grant you an interview.

Think about blogging through the following lenses:

1. **Your blog is for you**. Writing a blog gives you an opportunity to solidify knowledge or gain depth of understanding. Your ability to communicate about your work, both verbally and in writing, is essential for success as a data scientist. Blogging is a great way to reflect on your work and helps you consolidate everything you've learned and decide how you want to grow next.

2. **Your blog is for your peers**. At some point in the program you will find a peer's blog to be helpful or inspiring. You can be that person for someone else!

3. **Your blog is for the larger community**. As you go through the course you will be googling for things and find blog posts that others have written that will be immensely helpful to you. It may not feel like it, but you already know enough to contribute back to the community. If the blog post you are writing would have helped you last week, someone else will find it useful and valuable.

4. **Your blog is for potential employers**. Your blog posts can be an additional bullet point to add to your resume and a way to establish your presence and credibility. Student blogs have been picked up by Medium publications and students have even _become exempt from technical interviews_ due to knowledge they demonstrated in a blogpost!

## What to Blog About?

Here are some suggested blog topics:

* Why did you decide to learn data science? What did you consider when deciding whether to join Flatiron's DS program?

* Pick a DS technique of your choice (e.g. KNN), describe how it works, when you might use it, and its strengths or weaknesses.

* An overview of your End-of-Phase project, where you explain your problem, the dataset, your methodology, and findings.

* Do a deep dive into something that you want to learn more about, you find it challenging (e.g. distance metrics in recommendation systems) or it wasn't covered in the course (e.g. Data Science in R).

* Write a tutorial to help aspiring data scientists to implement a tool or method.

* Pick a data science paper and rewrite it to explain it to a non-technical business stakeholder. Focus on why it’s important and why it would matter to them.

## Length and Style Suggestions

### Quantity and Quality

Aim for reasonable quantity and great quality. You must complete all the required blog posts, but we recommend you make sure to have a few very polished ones to showcase to employers. These posts should demonstrate that you can write for both technical and non-technical audiences. Don't go crazy publishing a ton of blog posts during your program - you likely won't have time to polish them all, and you'll risk an employer seeing a mediocre one and losing interest. You will have time to continue contributing to your blog after graduation

### Length

Strike a balance between providing a meaningful investigation of your topic and being concise. Constrain the scope so it will be interesting and easily digestible in about 1000-3000 words (this is not a firm limit).

### Formatting

Use clear and consistent formatting to make your content accessible and professional-looking.

* When presenting code, use code snippets instead of screenshots. This will allow others to copy and paste your code if following along with your post.
* Make URLs into hyperlinks that are easy for readers to click into.
* Use headings to provide structure and flow to your post.

### Citations

Always cite and link to resources you used to write your post. This is not only an ethical responsibility for all writers, but also will give your readers more to dig into if they're interested.

## How to Start Your Blog

If you already have a professional blog that you'd like to use for your data science content, feel free just to add your posts to that. Otherwise, you will need to start a new professional blog. If you have a personal blog, we strongly recommend you avoid using it for this purpose so that you can continue using it for personal content without worrying about how it might be perceived by potential employers.

There are multiple blogging platforms to choose from that make it easy to start a blog, here are some of our favorites:

* [Blogger][https://www.blogger.com/]
* [dev.to][https://dev.to/]
* [Medium][https://medium.com/]
* [Wordpress][https://wordpress.com/]

Different platforms have different pros and cons, so do a little research to decide what is best for you. For example, we have had students with [Medium][https://medium.com/] blogs get their posts promoted on [Towards Data Science][], which boosted their visibility. However, [Medium][https://medium.com/] requires an account to read articles and limits the number of premium articles that can be read for free, so fewer people may stumble across your post.

✨Have fun and happy blogging!✨
